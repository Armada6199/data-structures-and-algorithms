# What i learned from my prep-project

## Debounce function ,Debouncing is a way to delay a some functionality ,it is usefull to make sure that one heavy functionality doesn't get called or executed very often .

##  Let's say you have a form and you need to validate it then request a search from the API  and rerender the componet based on the search result from the backend ,and that backend takes alot of time and resources to compute ,doing that search on every user input is not very efficient so you need a way to delay that request and thats way is **DEBOUNCING **.


### You*can  create your own debounce function or react hook it may be hard at first to understand but it will benfit you alot and save you alot of time in the appllication long term*
