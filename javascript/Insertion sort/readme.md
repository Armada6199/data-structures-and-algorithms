# Insertion Sort Algorithm Documentation

## Overview

The insertion sort algorithm builds a sorted array incrementally by repeatedly inserting elements from the unsorted section into their correct position within the sorted section.

## Implementation

1. Begin with the first element as the sorted section.
2. For each subsequent unsorted element:
   - Compare and shift elements in the sorted section until the correct position is found.
   - Insert the element into its appropriate sorted position.
3. Repeat until all elements are sorted.

## Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n^2) in worst and average cases.
- Space Complexity: O(1).


## Test Results

- Passed: All tests succeeded.
