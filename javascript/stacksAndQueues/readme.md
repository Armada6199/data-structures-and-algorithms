# STACKS && QUEUES

## Stack

### This Stack Featuers those methods

1-peek, which returns the top element and takes O(1) time.\
2-push ,which add an element to the top of the stack and takes O(1).\
3-pop,which removes the top element and returns it and takes o(1).\
4-print all data ,which prints all the nodes in the stack.\
5-isEmpty,which return false if the stack is empty otherwise it return true.\


## Queue

### This Queue Featuers those methods

1-peek, which returns the front element and takes O(1) time.\
2-enqueue ,which add an element to the back of the queue and takes O(1).\
3-dequeue,which removes the back element and returns it and takes o(1).\
4-print all data ,which prints all the nodes in the stack.\
